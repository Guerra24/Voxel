# Voxel
This is a voxel engine type programmed in java using LWJGL and OpenGL 3.3, uses features that are not deprecated.
I'm not using OpenGL 4.0+ because my gpu only supports up to OpenGL 3.3

# TODO
+Simple Culling
+Frustrim Culling
+Blocks collisions
+Real Ilumiation
+Bind Player and Camera class
+Noise based world generation
+Save chunks

Necessarily requires a GPU that supports OpenGL 3.3+
