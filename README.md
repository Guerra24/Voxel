# Voxel
This is a voxel engine type that is programmed in Java, using LWJGL and OpenGL3.3+ . Is designed to be scalable and modular, allowing you to modify specific parts of the code and improve it, it is in a very early stage of development. Any help is greatly appreciated.

When the project is in a more stable and complete stage, my plan is to develop an API for the implementation of mods.
